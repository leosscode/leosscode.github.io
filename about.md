title: About me 
---
My name is Leo, I am 34 and live in the sunny Rio de Janeiro. 
I am involved in some personal projects (one of them is a platform for waste recycling) and always looking for a challenging new projects to work on.

I have large experience (10yrs +) as Java/JEE Developer, IT Consultant, and Project Manager working  for global IT companies like IBM, TATA TCS, Isobar, Razorfish, and for other local Brazilian companies and startups.

I like to code and to listen to music. :)
